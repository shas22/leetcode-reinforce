Takeaways & Big ideas: 
Using hashmap key values as a way to flip them in a array index and value to find the frequency is a really clever technique. The main takeaway is that you can flip multiple data structures to solve a problem and in this case the hashmap value where {num: frequency} is flipped to arr[frequency] = num where the ith position of the array represents the frequency. Got to keep this in mind.
