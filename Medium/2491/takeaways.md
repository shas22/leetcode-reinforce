Takeaways & Big ideas: 
This problem could be solved in multiple ways. I am surprised that I came with the solution pretty quickly too. Took about 23 mins. I guess there is progression! 

Regardless, I think aside from complements method another potential way is to solve via 2 pointers too. Maybe I could implement that as a additional learning point. The 2nd half of this problem is similar to a array problem from a older question too which used complements finding. My initial approach though was to use a stack system to pop off elements but soon realized that's gonna be possible.
