<h1>Purpose</h1>

This repo is just for reinforcing and practising ideas I've already known and solidifying them. Got inspired by people putting out solutions so I thought maybe I can have my own repo where it's easy to navigate and find solutions that I already have solved before. 

This also acts as a motivation for me to solve atleast one problem a day. 

<h2>Usage</h2>

If you come across this, take a look at my solutions if you're interested and then if you think you have a better solution do contact me with a better solution as I'm constantly learning how to get better at this.

<h2>Patterns & Implementations</h2>

I prefer learning things from the ground up and this means learning how core structures and algorithms are implementation and fully understanding why they work. 

I am also documenting patterns I find and/or learn from resources I am using so that I can refer back to them when I need to.

If you happen to stumble upon the patterns folder, hopefully it helps you understand things at a fundamental level.
