<h1>Purpose</h1>

This repo is just for reinforcing and practising ideas I've already known and solidifying them. Got inspired by people putting out solutions so I thought maybe I can have my own repo where it's easy to navigate and find solutions that I already have solved before. 
This also acts as a motivation for me to solve atleast one problem a day. 
I have already been solving a lot of problems before I started this repo, thus this isn't as updated as my actual Leetcode progress.

Check out my [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/shas22/) profile!

<h2>Usage</h2>

If you come across this, take a look at my solutions if you're interested and then if you think you have a better solution do contact me with a better solution as I'm constantly learning how to get better at this.

<h2>Patterns & Implementations</h2>

I prefer learning things from the ground up and this means learning how core structures and algorithms are implemented and fully understanding why they work. Thus, this section is purely to see how things work under the hood of the tools used in DSA. 

I am also documenting patterns I find and/or learn from resources I am using so that I can refer back to them when I need to.

***If you happen to stumble upon the patterns folder, hopefully it helps you understand things at a fundamental level.***


<h2>Metrics for absolutely no reason</h2>
