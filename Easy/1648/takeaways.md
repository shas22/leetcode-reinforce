Takeaways & Big ideas: 
Doing things before and after a nested loop to check for conditions. I was obsessing over trying to figure out, how to use just a counter and addition and subtraction to represent but using a boolean before and after the nested loop was the most straight forward solution.


Analysis: 
Kept getting stuck on one idea, should be explore multiple ways.
